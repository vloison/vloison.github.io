excerpt: 'In human patients, overdosing during general anesthesia can lead to cognitive impairment. Cortical electro-encephalograms are used to measure the depth of anesthesia. They allow for correction, but not prevention, of overdose. However, data-driven approaches open new possibilities to predict the depth of anesthesia. We established an electro-encephalogram signal-processing pipeline, and constructed a predictive map representing an ensemble of gradual sedation states during general anesthesia in mice. In particular, we identified crucial electro-encephalogram patterns which anticipate signs of overdose several minutes before they occur. Our results bring a novel paradigm to the medical community, allowing for the development of individually tailored and predictive anesthetic regimens.'
