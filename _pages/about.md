Welcome!

I am a first year PhD student at [MIND](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) (Inria Saclay) and Lariboisère (INSERM). I work under the supervision of [Thomas Moreau](https://tommoral.github.io) and [Jérôme Cartailler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9ZMnTioAAAAJ&hl=fr) on point processes methods for intra-operative physiological data (EEG, ECG). \\

I previously studied Machine Learning and Computer Science at Ecole des Ponts Paristech and at Master MVA (Mathematics, Vision and Learning) hosted by École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay.
