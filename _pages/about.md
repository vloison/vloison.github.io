Welcome!

I am a first-year PhD student at [MIND](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) (Inria Saclay) and Lariboisière (INSERM). I am supervised by [Thomas Moreau](https://tommoral.github.io) and [Jérôme Cartailler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9ZMnTioAAAAJ&hl=fr). I work on event-based machine learning methods for intra-operative physiological data (EEG, ECG).

I previously studied Mathematics, Machine Learning and Computer Science at Ecole des Ponts Paristech and at Master MVA (Mathematics, Vision and Learning) hosted by École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay.
